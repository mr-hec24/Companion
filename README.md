# Companion

## About
This project is using Vercel, NEXT.js, Supabase, Tailwind, and Posthog to create a project for my long-distance girlfriend, Isabella. 

This is a project to help couples grow in their relationship with each other by taking care of a cute Companion together! 

A digital platform designed for long-distance couples to nurture their relationship by caring for a virtual pet together. Through collaborative challenges, real-time interactions, and shared responsibilities, couples can strengthen their bond while raising a digital companion. Grow your relationship with your Companion

## Notes
Ok, I am still working on how to get the couple invitation to be created, accepted, and displayed properly. I've had issues with all three aspects. 

Also having issues accessing the profile picture that is saved in Supabase, I need to see what is up with that too

I think that using AI for this project might be far too complicated for it to keep track of all of the changes. i might have to start using my own brain and tracking to understand what is going on.
